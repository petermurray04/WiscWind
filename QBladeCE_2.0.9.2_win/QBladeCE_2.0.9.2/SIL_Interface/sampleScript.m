% This is a minimum working example on how to interface with the QBlade
% library. A project called 'NREL_5MW_Sample.qpr' has been provided to work with. 
% This script establishes a connection to the QBlade library, calls the library
% QBLADE and then initializes QBlade and the project. It runs the
% simulation for 500 simulation steps, and outputs some values. The time length
% of the simulation equals the number of simulation steps times the time
% step with which the simulation has been set up. At the end, the QBlade
% instance is closed again.
